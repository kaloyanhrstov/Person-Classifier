# Person-Classifier
Documentation - person_classifier_model.ipynb

In this project, our goal is to identify and categorize the images of my favorite celebrities. I have selected five people in total, including Lionel Messi, Andrew Tate, Elon Musk, Leonardo DiCaprio, and the one and only - Rumen Radev. 
To gather the images of these celebrities, we will be using a chrome extension called Fatkun. Once we have collected the images, we will clean the data to ensure it is appropriate for training the classifier. Additionally, we will apply 
wavelet transform to extract meaningful features such as eyes, nose, and lips, to help us identify the celebrities with greater accuracy. After training the model, we will create a website that allows users to drag and drop an image of a 
celebrity and receive an instant identification of which of the five celebrities the uploaded photo resembles.
